// Webhook authentication, following Shopify's documented HMAC verification:
// https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/verify-deliveries#hmac-verification
//
// The rules that matter there:
//   • HMAC-SHA256 the RAW request body, keyed with the app's client secret
//   • the X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256 header is base64 — decode before comparing
//   • compare with a timing-safe equality check, never ===
//   • reject any delivery whose signatures don't match (400 or 401)
//   • acknowledge a good delivery with 200; anything outside 2xx counts as an
//     error, and Shopify gives up after a 5s request timeout
//
// authenticate.webhook() already does all of this. The explicit pass below runs
// first as defence in depth: it fails closed if the library's behaviour ever
// changes, and it makes the verification auditable in our own code rather than
// buried in a dependency.
