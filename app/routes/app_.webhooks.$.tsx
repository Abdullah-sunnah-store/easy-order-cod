// Alias for the webhook endpoints under /app/webhooks/*.
//
// The canonical paths are /webhooks/* (routes/webhooks.*.tsx). But a relative
// webhook `uri` in the app config is resolved against application_url at deploy
// time, so an application_url carrying an /app path registers every webhook at
// /app/webhooks/... — which matched no route, and is what Shopify's compliance
// probe hit at /app/webhooks/shop/redact.
//
// The right fix is an application_url with no path, which the config files
// enforce. This exists so a stale registration can't fail the compliance check
// again: either path reaches the same handler, and the handler verifies the
// HMAC exactly as before. It grants nothing — an unsigned request still gets
// 401 here.
//
// The trailing underscore in the filename (`app_.`) keeps this out of the
// app.tsx layout. Nested under it, every delivery would hit authenticate.admin()
// and be bounced to OAuth instead of being processed.
