// `npm run dev`, wrapped so it cleans up after itself.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//
// `shopify app dev` repoints the INSTALLED app at a Cloudflare tunnel, so the
// embedded iframe loads your local server instead of Vercel. That is what makes
// local development possible — and it is also a live grenade: the moment the
// session ends the tunnel stops resolving, and anyone who opens the app gets
// the browser's "server IP address could not be found" page. A merchant. You.
// An App Store reviewer.
//
// Worse, nothing in the repo shows it. The CLI restores the local .toml files
// on exit, so `git status` is clean and both configs read as Vercel. The stale
// URL lives only in the Partner dashboard, which means the only way to notice
// is for someone to open the app and find it broken.
//
// So the restore does not get left to memory. This wrapper runs
// `shopify app dev`, waits for it to finish however it finishes — Ctrl-C
// included — and then re-releases the production config over whatever the
// dashboard is holding.
//
// The one case it cannot cover is the terminal window being closed outright,
// which kills this process too. If that happens, run `npm run urls:restore`.
